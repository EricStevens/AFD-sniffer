AFD-sniffer
===========
The Big Idea here is to...
1) Automatically grab all AFDs written by WFOs in Alaska Region.  We will grab these files tiwce a day...and since the
files are tiny text jobbers, we will store them locally and build a local archive over time.
2) The AFDs will be searched for certain character strings.
3) When such a search makes a "hit," a notification will be made, perhaps as an email to certain people's
email addresses hard-wired into the code, and/or a "hit file" will be updated with the latest info appended to 
the file and stored locally.
